Assumptions:
1.) We assumed that you are unable to print string literals because it was too difficult to set up the grammer with
    everything
2.) We assumed that you cannot perform modifications on the variavle that pertains to the for loop. So if it says
    a := 10 to 20 you cant perform any operations on the loop other than print the variable
3.) We assumed that all bodies of if statements start with a 'begin' and finish with and 'end', even though that is optional
    in actual pascal language. This made parsing and scoping much easier.
